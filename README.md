This repo contains two directories - Test Artifacts and Test cases. Test artifacts contains all documantation related to preparation for testing, test execution and test analysis result activities. Test cases contains all needed code for executing the automated test cases.

Test cases directory contains three files - collection of the written test cases - Explore the applications via requests, results of the last test run - Current Weather Data and the library of global variables - My Workspace.

For test execution please upload two files Explore the applications via requests and My Workspace. Import collection "Explore the applications via requests" in the "Collection" section in Postman and library of global variables "My Workspace" in "Manage Environmet" section.

All requests in the "Explore the applications via requests" collection use global variables from "My Workplace" file.

After that this collection of test can be run in "Collection Runner" in Postman. All the test cases are designed for receaving the results according to functional verifications and performance of the requests. Any other settings shouldn't be set for running these collection.

At the end you can receave the results of the test runs.

In order to compare the results of testing you can import the previous results of test runs. In this case you should import "Current Weather Data" file into "Collection Runner" in Postman.
